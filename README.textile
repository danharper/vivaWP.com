vivaWP is an upcoming open-source WordPress framework to simplify the process of creating advanced theme functionality through a simple API. Just drop the @viva@ folder into your theme directory, and one line of code to your @functions.php@ and enable whatever features you want to use.

This is the 'Coming Soon' page for the project.
